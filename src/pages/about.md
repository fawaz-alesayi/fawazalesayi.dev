I'm a Software Engineer born in Saudi Arabia. Got into programming by modding World Of Warcraft Private Servers where I fiddled around with SQL, C++, and x86 Assembly. After that, I got a BsC in Software Engineering from King Fahd University for Petroleum, and learned fullstack web, Flutter, and Rust along the way. And right now I spend my days creating side-projects and applying for online hackathons I'll probably never finish, and writing this blog (hopefully these two things never intersect.)
