# fawazalesayi.dev

My dev blog, created with [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte);

Feel free to talk anything about the blog in the issues.

## Usage

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
pnpm dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm dev -- --open
```

## Building

Before creating a production version of this blog, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
pnpm build
```

> You can preview the built app with `pnpm preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
