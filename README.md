My dev blog, created with [`astro`](https://astro.build);

Feel free to talk anything about me, this repo or the blog in the issues.

## Usage

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `pnpm i`

```bash
pnpm dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm dev -- --open
```

## Building

```bash
pnpm build
```

> You can preview the built app with `pnpm preview`, This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
